Hello! I am a senior physics major here at UMBC with a career interest in meteorology. Currently, I use numerical computing and remote sensing data to help solve the mysteries of our atmosphere and beyond. In me, you'll find a persistent worker who is open to learning new skills and is never afraid to ask questions.
