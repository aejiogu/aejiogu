Hello! I am a meteorology PhD student at Penn State, with a BS in Physics from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Currently, I use numerical computing and remote sensing data to help solve the mysteries of our atmosphere and beyond. In me, you'll find a persistent worker who is open to learning new skills and is never afraid to ask questions.
